### How to install Git?

To clone a repository, you will need to have Git installed on your computer. If you don't already have it, you can download it from the official Git website (https://git-scm.com/downloads).

<br>
Once the download is complete, continue with the following steps:

1. Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Git on your computer.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and type git --version to verify that Git has been installed.
3. Configure your name and email address. Git uses this information to associate your commits with your identity. You can use the following commands to set your name and email address:<br>
git config --global user.name "Your Name"<br>
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
